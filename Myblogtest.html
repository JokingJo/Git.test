        <h2> About me</h2><p>This will contain my history, motivations and probably strongly highlight my mistakes and vices</p>
    <h2> The <em>Venting</em> <strong>scientist</strong></h2>
    <h3> A <strong>honest</strong> account of the scientific world</h3>
        <p> This is a blog to highlight the problems of the sciences or more accurately describe,in detail, the experiences of this scientist.
            I do not think my experiences are isolated but for the purpose of truth, I dont want to assume that the patterns I have seen are not my own confirmation bias. Sadly if I write this as a completely factual account it would take away the more fundamental aspects of my own experience and probably be boring as it would only highlight facts that I can substantiate with data which sadly is not where it should be. To stop people from reading this that may not actually be interested I will make a disclosure right off the bat. I think science is a powerful force in the world, I think it is the yang to the artist ying. It is important to in the program of life to have developers which try to push the extremes of the limits and ideas we have and the science and the error checking and statisitical software to ensure changes are positive and significant.

<h2> Timing</h2>
        <p>This blog is a start for me and as a busy human I will try to make regular posting for myself. I will at some point update this with a table with my schedule.

</p>
<h2> Other interests
</h2><p>I am like everyone else that my life and personality is not easy and one-dimensional. I will continue to add my interests to this section as I go along</p>
<h2> Contact</h2><p> In time once my life is in more order I will add a way for people to contact me and a platform for myself other than this blog that is more interesting ie video/picture</p>
